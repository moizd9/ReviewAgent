## How Was This Built?

Here’s a look behind the curtain at how ReviewAgent works:

- **Framework**: Built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for a fast, clean interface that runs in the browser.
- **Review Retrieval**: Uses [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) to fetch reviews from Google Maps for any business name input by the user.
- **AI Response Generation**: Each review is passed to OpenAI’s GPT-4o to generate an appropriate and unique reply.
- **Fail-Safe Mode**: If SerpAPI credits are exhausted or there is a fetch issue, the app shows a custom maintenance message instead of crashing.
- **Output**: The user can download all generated responses as a CSV file for easy integration with CRMs or scheduling tools.

The app is fully self-contained — no need to upload CSVs or manage tokens on your own.
