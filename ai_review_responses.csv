The service was very slow - even with as many baristas running around, there are a lot of people waiting on orders. Interesting decor above the counter.","Thank you for your feedback!

We specifically asked to purchase with stars, but the worker there didn't use our stars, and when we reached out to talk again, he ignored us and kept taking orders from other customers. So, we waited in line 2 more times just to talk to him. After waiting, he told us to wait for the manager, and we did while he was joking around with another worker. The manager was nice. When I asked the manager whether only manager can do the refund, but the answer was no. Such an unpleasant experience. I would have given a 0 star if it exists.",Thank you for sharing your experience with us.

I bought a tumbler and asked if I could have my coffee in it, paid and then a woman talked me down because she didn‚Äôt like me buying the cup and wanting my beverage in it (has never been a problem at Starbucks before), then the drink spilled over and the tumbler was sticky from the coffee. Then another woman who worked there, threw away half my drink and gave it back to me. It was rude and unpleasant. I am very disappointed.","Thank you for sharing your experience with us; we‚Äôre truly sorry to hear about the service you received and the issues with your tumbler.
